# Universal-Acceptance
The concept that all domain names should be treated equally

Universal Acceptance (UA) is the state where all valid domain names and email addresses are 
accepted, 
validated, 
stored, 
processed and 
displayed correctly and consistently 

by all Internet-enabled applications, devices and systems.

Universal Acceptance is a foundational requirement for a truly multilingual Internet, one in which users around the world can navigate entirely in local languages. It is also the key to unlocking the potential of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to foster competition, consumer choice and innovation in the domain name industry. To achieve Universal Acceptance, Internet applications and systems must treat all TLDs in a consistent manner, including new gTLDs and internationalized TLDs. Specifically, they must accept, validate, store, process and display all domain names.
